# Go Basics Implementation

### Basic Topics:
#### 1. Packages, Variables, and Functions
Encompasses packages, imports, functions and Basic Data Types


#### 2. Flow Control Statements
Encompasses For(while) loops, if and else, switch conditions, and defer


#### 3. More Types: structs, slices, and maps
Encompasses pointers, structs, arrays, slices, range, maps and function closures.

### Methods and Interfaces:
Encompasses methods, pointer receivers, pointer indirection, interfaces, type assertions and switches,  stringers, erros, readers, images

### Generics:
Encompasses Type parameters, Generic Types

### Concurrency:
Encompasses goroutines, channels, range and close, select, sync.Mutex
